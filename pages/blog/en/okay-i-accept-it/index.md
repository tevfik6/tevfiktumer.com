It's been awhile I can't find some time to write something here although I have cool plans about writing blogs. Recently, I thought maybe it's because I'm a bit perfectionist.  

I thought maybe I even should write such posts that don't talk about anything but me. It won't have any information but my current status(excuses) why I cannot write any post.

I believe any step is better than not to move at all. If I reach the right moment, I can add useful posts as well. It seems like I've got to burn a couple of posts to reach proper ones. Hopefully, someday I will be talking about following topics;

* Recent projects I'm working on Sublime Text 
* Most common/frequently used regular expressions. 
* News about Javascript ES2016, VueJS, Laravel
* Deferred Objects and $.when in jQuery.

Keep tune. Later!
