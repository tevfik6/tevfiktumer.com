This post is my first English blog post. 

I cannot say I'm a good blogger. Past 10+ years, I've built multiple projects including my personal blogs, but I could not post my works into my blogs.

While implementing the personal website, this time something motivated me and built this blog with multi-language support.

Hopefully, this post will be the first English and motivate me to continue writing other posts in English and other languages. 

At this moment, I have some ideas what to write into the blog. I will try to share sometimes really simple daily solutions that I'm using, or news or just random posts or maybe a note that I'm often searching online to get things done. 

So wish me luck and support for the other posts! :)

Hope to see you soon again.
