short: "<p>It is wild that the world is going interesting and rough times. Past year I aimed to do bunch of things and as many of us I also couldn't achieve most of it. This year I decided to put things a little more obvious places like here. I'm planning to drop some summer of the months. Maybe I will be writing during the month these lines but for this particular post, I'm building my post on the day I'm publishing this post. </p>"

It is wild that the world is going interesting and rough times. Past year I aimed to do bunch of things and as many of us I also couldn't achieve most of it. This year I decided to put things a little more obvious places like here. I'm planning to drop some summary of the months. Maybe I will be writing during the month these lines but for this particular post, I'm building my post on the day I'm publishing this post. 

I've started to read much more periodically. Up until now looking back for January, without putting any pressure, I've read 628 pages. It makes it average 20 pages a day. This month I've read 2,5 books so far. 

Beside reading book, I started to code go language from scratch. Literally I had no idea how it is, what it is how does it work. Open a file start writing random stuff. Eventually I really enjoy go language. Currently they are 1.16 but it looks like 1.18 beta is on the way. I do not know what is the difference but I've covered most of the part of the go language with in a month. I've also started to build a project where I can use every day at work. Actually there are not only one, but also two. But they all too much of try and failures but eventually they are super helpful and time saver for my day to day work. 

If I can implement a little more I can also introduce them to the team in the company where they can take benefit. One of the project I'm planning to publicly as Open Source release. But I'm still not sure I can nest a go project into another project. I've seen some examples in Dockers Github repo but it is too new to accelerate too quick. Considering, for a month how far I've gone and I've achieve with Go, I really liked it. 
I guess what I like Go, reminds me C times where I was coding around 2005 and I was enjoying the speed and power. Go gave me the same feeling in 2022. I've been planning to learn the go but somehow Python took its place and I postponed it. 

Looking into Go, seems like it is still developing and very recently they made big changes that I did not even experience the pain of it. Due to the requirements of the application for my daily base work, I did not deep dive other parts of the language like networking, parallel programming, thread management etc. I used channels but I'm feel still I need to exercise more on that. Planning to also publish here things I found and useful to share (but also come back check incase I need to copy/pasta). 

I've also bought Apple Watch 7. Previously I was using Apple Watch 3 series. It is very different after using 3. So far except screen size I did not feel much of difference.
